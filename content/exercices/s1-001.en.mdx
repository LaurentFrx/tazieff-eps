## Instructions
- Elbows under shoulders, forearms parallel, neck long.
- Pull in the stomach (sheathing) and slightly contract the buttocks.
- Maintain head-trunk-pelvis-leg alignment (avoid arching).
- Push down with forearms (shoulders "away from ears").
- Breathe continuously without blocking.

## Dosage
3 to 5 sets of 20 to 45 seconds (aim for quality before quantity).

## Frequent errors
- Pelvis too high or too low.
- Relaxed shoulders.

## Safety
- Adapt in case of low-back pain: reduce duration, switch to kneeling, or incline support.
- Avoid in case of acute disc herniation, radiated pain or unstabilized pathology (professional advice).
- Overweight/seniors: prefer inclined plank (hands on bench) or on knees.
- Do not force if posture collapses (falling pelvis / hyperlordosis).
